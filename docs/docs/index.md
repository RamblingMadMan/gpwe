## General Purpose World Engine

GPWE is designed to make creating any 3D world as easy as possible. These worlds can be used in a dedicated application (i.e. a game or simulation) or within an existing application (i.e. a map editor or IDE).

The engine has a modular design with 'plugins' handling most of the vital functionality. For developer convenience the following plugins are included:

- OpenGL 4.3 Renderer
- Bullet Physics
